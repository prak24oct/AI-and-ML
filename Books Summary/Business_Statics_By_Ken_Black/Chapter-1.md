### **Chapter 1: Introduction to Statistics**  

#### **Overview**  
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data to support decision-making. In business, statistics helps organizations optimize strategies, assess risks, and improve performance.  

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Methods for summarizing data using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.  
- **Inferential Statistics:** Techniques for making predictions or generalizations about a population based on sample data.  
- **Levels of Data Measurement:**  
  - **Nominal:** Categorical data without order (e.g., gender, brand names).  
  - **Ordinal:** Ordered categories without equal differences (e.g., satisfaction ratings).  
  - **Interval:** Numeric data with equal spacing but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).  
  - **Ratio:** Numeric data with a true zero point (e.g., revenue, weight).  

#### **Important Formulas**  
- **Mean (Average):** \( \bar{x} = \frac{\sum X}{n} \)  
- **Variance:** \( \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (X - \bar{x})^2}{n} \)  
- **Standard Deviation:** \( \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} \)  

#### **Real-World Applications**  
- Businesses use statistical models for market analysis, customer segmentation, and performance tracking.  
- Banks assess risk levels using probability distributions.  
- Manufacturing firms rely on quality control statistics to minimize defects.  

#### **Practice Questions**  
1. Differentiate between descriptive and inferential statistics.  
2. Classify the following data types:  
   - Monthly income of employees  
   - Customer satisfaction rating (1 to 5 scale)  
3. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for this dataset: {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}.
