### **Chapter 3: Descriptive Statistics**  

#### **Overview**  
Descriptive statistics summarize and organize data to facilitate understanding. This chapter introduces measures of central tendency, variability, and shape, which help describe datasets effectively.

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**  
  - **Mean (Average):** The sum of values divided by the number of observations.  
  - **Median:** The middle value in an ordered dataset.  
  - **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.  
- **Measures of Variability:**  
  - **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values.  
  - **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The spread between the 25th and 75th percentiles.  
  - **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Indicate the dispersion of data from the mean.  
- **Measures of Shape:**  
  - **Skewness:** Describes data asymmetry.  
  - **Kurtosis:** Measures how heavily tails in a distribution differ from a normal distribution.  
  - **Box-and-Whisker Plots:** Graphically display data distribution and outliers.  

#### **Important Formulas**  
- **Mean:** \( \bar{x} = \frac{\sum X}{n} \)  
- **Variance:** \( \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (X - \bar{x})^2}{n} \)  
- **Standard Deviation:** \( \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} \)  
- **Z-Score:** \( Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \) (Measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.)  

#### **Real-World Applications**  
- **Performance Analysis:** Businesses use averages to evaluate employee productivity.  
- **Financial Risk Assessment:** Standard deviation helps investors measure stock volatility.  
- **Market Research:** Companies analyze customer purchase patterns using central tendency and dispersion.  

#### **Practice Questions**  
1. Compute the mean, median, and mode for {10, 20, 30, 30, 40, 50}.  
2. Calculate the standard deviation for {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}.  
3. What does a high standard deviation indicate about data spread?
