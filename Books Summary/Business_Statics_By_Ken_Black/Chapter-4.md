### **Chapter 4: Probability**  

#### **Overview**  
Probability is the foundation of inferential statistics and helps in predicting the likelihood of different business outcomes. This chapter introduces fundamental probability concepts and rules used in decision-making.

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Probability Basics:**  
  - **Experiment:** A process that produces an outcome (e.g., rolling a die).  
  - **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes.  
  - **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space.  
- **Types of Probability:**  
  - **Classical Probability:** Based on equally likely outcomes (e.g., rolling a fair die).  
  - **Empirical Probability:** Based on observed data (e.g., survey results).  
  - **Subjective Probability:** Based on personal judgment or experience.  
- **Probability Rules:**  
  - **Addition Rule:**  
    \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]  
  - **Multiplication Rule:**  
    \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B | A) \]  
  - **Conditional Probability:**  
    \[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]  
- **Bayes' Theorem:** Helps update probabilities based on new information.  

#### **Real-World Applications**  
- **Credit Risk Assessment:** Banks use probability to determine loan default risk.  
- **Stock Market Analysis:** Investors predict stock price movements using probability distributions.  
- **Quality Control:** Manufacturers assess defect probabilities to improve production processes.  

#### **Practice Questions**  
1. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a fair six-sided die?  
2. Compute the probability of drawing a heart from a standard deck of 52 cards.  
3. Use Bayes' Theorem to update probabilities when new data is available.
