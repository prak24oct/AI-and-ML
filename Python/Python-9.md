Here are detailed and comprehensive revision notes on **Anonymous/Lambda Functions** in Python, including examples, explanations, and related concepts:

---

### **Anonymous / Lambda Functions**

In Python, an **anonymous function** is a function defined without a name. While regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword, anonymous functions are created using the `lambda` keyword. These functions are often used for short-term operations where defining a full function would be unnecessary or cumbersome.

---

### **Syntax of Lambda Functions**
The syntax for a lambda function is:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
- **Arguments**: The input values to the function.
- **Expression**: A single-line operation that is evaluated and returned.

Lambda functions are inherently single-expression functions and cannot contain multiple statements or complex logic.

---

### **Example: Lambda vs Regular Function**

#### Using Lambda:
```python
double = lambda x: x ** 2
print(double(5))  # Output: 25
```

#### Equivalent Regular Function:
```python
def double(x):
    return x ** 2

print(double(5))  # Output: 25
```

Lambda functions are concise and suitable for simple operations but lack the flexibility and readability of regular functions for complex logic.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Lambda Functions**
1. **Anonymous Nature**: Lambda functions do not have a name unless explicitly assigned to a variable.
2. **Compact**: They are written in a single line, making them concise.
3. **Use Cases**: Commonly used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for short-term operations.
4. **Limitations**: Cannot include multiple expressions or statements.

---

### **Important Note**
Avoid using Python **keywords** as identifiers for variables, functions, or classes. For example:
```python
func = lambda x, y: x + y  # Valid
sum = lambda x, y: x + y  # Invalid, as 'sum' is a Python keyword
```

---

### **Lambda with Dynamic Inputs**
Lambda functions can accept a variable number of arguments using the `*args` syntax:
```python
get_sum = lambda *n: sum(n)

print(get_sum(1))                 # Output: 1
print(get_sum(1, 2))              # Output: 3
print(get_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))     # Output: 15
```

This is equivalent to:
```python
def get_sum(*n):
    return sum(n)
```

---

### **Functions vs Methods**
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task, not tied to any object. Example:
  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
  ```

- **Method**: A function that is associated with an object and operates on the data within that object. Example:
  ```python
  list_names = ['ramesh', 'sukesh', 'mahesh']
  print(list_names.index('sukesh'))  # 'index' is a method of the list class
  ```

#### Key Difference:
- **Methods** are invoked on objects and can access the object's data.
- **Functions** are standalone and do not depend on any object.

---

### **Using Lambda for Conditional Logic**
Lambda functions can include conditional logic using the `if-else` expression:
```python
even_or_odd = lambda n: 'even' if n % 2 == 0 else 'odd'

print(even_or_odd(4))  # Output: 'even'
print(even_or_odd(3))  # Output: 'odd'
```

Equivalent regular function:
```python
def even_or_odd(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 'even'
    else:
        return 'odd'
```

---

### **Lambda with Built-in Functions**

#### **1. Filtering Data**
Using `filter()` to extract even numbers from a tuple:
```python
tuple_int = (4, 1, 3, 8, 9, 2, 3, 6, 77, 22, 44, 7)

even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, tuple_int))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [4, 8, 2, 6, 22, 44]
```

Equivalent list comprehension:
```python
even_numbers = [x for x in tuple_int if x % 2 == 0]
```

#### **2. Transforming Data**
Using `map()` to square all numbers in a list:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

#### **3. Reducing Data**
Using `reduce()` to compute the product of a list:
```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product)  # Output: 24
```

---

### **Summary**
- Lambda functions are compact, anonymous, and single-expression functions.
- They are best suited for short-term use with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
- While concise, they are less readable and flexible compared to regular functions for complex logic.
- Understanding the differences between functions and methods helps clarify their respective use cases.
- Lambda functions, combined with Python's built-in functions, provide powerful tools for functional programming.

By mastering lambda functions and their applications, you can write cleaner, more efficient Python code for various scenarios.

### Comprehensive Revision Notes on `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` Functions in Python

---

### Overview

Python provides powerful functional programming tools like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to operate on iterables. These functions allow concise and efficient data processing, often combined with `lambda` functions for simplicity. Here's a detailed breakdown of each concept with examples and use cases.

---

### **`map()` Function**

The `map()` function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, etc.) and returns a new iterable with the transformed items.

#### Syntax:
```python
map(function, iterable)
```

- **`function`**: A function (can be user-defined or a lambda) to apply to each item.
- **`iterable`**: The data structure (list, tuple, etc.) whose items will be transformed.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Returns a `map` object, which can be converted into a list, tuple, or other iterable types.
- Commonly used with `lambda` functions for concise operations.

---

#### **Examples of `map()`**

1. **Calculate the length of each name in a list:**

   **Using a loop:**
   ```python
   list_names = ['Ram', 'Sita', 'Laxman', 'Arjun']
   len_list = []
   for name in list_names:
       len_list.append(len(name))
   print('Using a loop:', len_list)
   ```

   **Using a user-defined function (UDF):**
   ```python
   def get_length_names(names):
       return [len(name) for name in names]

   result = get_length_names(list_names)
   print('Using a UDF:', result)
   ```

   **Using `map()`:**
   ```python
   len_list = list(map(len, list_names))
   print('Using map():', len_list)
   ```

2. **Transform names to lowercase:**
   ```python
   lowercase_names = list(map(lambda x: x.lower(), list_names))
   print('Names in lowercase:', lowercase_names)
   ```

3. **Filter names based on a condition:**
   ```python
   filtered_names = list(map(lambda x: x if x in ('Ram', 'Sita') else None, list_names))
   print('Filtered names:', filtered_names)
   ```

---

### **`filter()` Function**

The `filter()` function filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns `True` or `False`.

#### Syntax:
```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

- **`function`**: A function that evaluates to `True` or `False`.
- **`iterable`**: The data structure to filter.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Returns a `filter` object, which can be converted to a list, tuple, etc.
- Items are included if the function returns `True`, excluded otherwise.

---

#### **Examples of `filter()`**

1. **Filter even numbers from a tuple:**

   **Using a loop:**
   ```python
   tuple_int = (4, 1, 3, 8, 9, 2, 3, 6, 77, 22, 44, 7)
   even_numbers = []
   for num in tuple_int:
       if num % 2 == 0:
           even_numbers.append(num)
   print('Using a loop:', even_numbers)
   ```

   **Using `filter()`:**
   ```python
   even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, tuple_int))
   print('Using filter():', even_numbers)
   ```

2. **Transform gender representation:**
   ```python
   gender = ['m', 'F', 'M', 'f', 'f', 'm']
   gender_transformed = list(map(lambda g: 0 if g.lower() == 'm' else 1, gender))
   print('Transformed gender:', gender_transformed)
   ```

---

### **`reduce()` Function**

The `reduce()` function applies a rolling computation to pairs of items in an iterable. Unlike `map()` and `filter()`, it reduces the iterable to a single cumulative value.

#### Syntax:
```python
from functools import reduce
reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])
```

- **`function`**: A function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.
- **`iterable`**: The data to process.
- **`initializer`**: (Optional) A starting value for the computation.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Always operates on two arguments at a time.
- Useful for operations like summation, product, finding maximum/minimum, etc.

---

#### **Examples of `reduce()`**

1. **Sum of elements with an initializer:**
   ```python
   b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, b, 12)
   print('Sum with initializer:', result)
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - Initial value: `12`
   - Steps:
     - `12 + 5 = 17`
     - `17 + 6 = 23`
     - `23 + 7 = 30`
     - `30 + 8 = 38`
     - `38 + 9 = 47`

2. **Product of elements:**
   ```python
   b = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, b)
   print('Product:', product)
   ```

---

### **Comparing `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`**

| Feature         | `map()`                           | `filter()`                        | `reduce()`                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Transforms each item in an iterable. | Filters items based on a condition. | Reduces an iterable to a single value. |
| **Returns**      | A transformed iterable.           | A filtered iterable.               | A single cumulative value.    |
| **Arguments**    | A function and an iterable.       | A function and an iterable.        | A function, iterable, and optional initializer. |
| **Common Use**   | Data transformation.              | Conditional filtering.             | Aggregation operations.       |

---

### **Advanced Examples Combining Concepts**

1. **Filter and Transform Together:**
   ```python
   tuple_int = (4, 1, 3, 8, 9, 2, 3, 6, 77, 22, 44, 7)
   even_squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, tuple_int)))
   print('Squares of even numbers:', even_squares)
   ```

2. **Nested Iterables with `map()` and `filter()`:**
   ```python
   nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
   even_nested = list(map(lambda x: [i for i in x if i % 2 == 0], nested_list))
   print('Filtered even numbers in nested lists:', even_nested)
   ```

---

### **Best Practices**
1. Use `lambda` functions for concise, throwaway logic.
2. Combine `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for efficient, readable code.
3. For complex logic, consider defining a reusable user-defined function (UDF).

By mastering these tools, you can write more Pythonic, efficient, and elegant code.

## Python: Global and Local Variables

In Python, variables can be classified into **global** and **local** based on their scope and accessibility within the program.

---

### **Global Variables**
- **Definition**: Variables declared outside any function or block are considered global. These variables can be accessed and modified throughout the program.
- **Scope**: Global variables have a global scope and are accessible inside functions unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name.

#### Example 1: Accessing a Global Variable Inside a Function
```python
x = "Hello"

def foo():
    print("x inside:", x)  # Accessing global variable

foo()
print("x outside:", x)  # Accessing the same global variable outside the function
```
**Output**:
```
x inside: Hello
x outside: Hello
```

#### Key Points:
- Global variables can be read inside a function without any special declaration.
- However, to modify a global variable inside a function, the `global` keyword must be used.

---

### **Local Variables**
- **Definition**: Variables declared inside a function or block are considered local. These variables are created when the function starts and destroyed when the function ends.
- **Scope**: Local variables are accessible only within the function where they are defined.

#### Example 2: Local Variable in a Function
```python
def foo():
    y = "local"
    print(y)  # Accessing local variable

foo()
# print(y)  # This will raise a NameError as y is not defined outside the function
```
**Output**:
```
local
```

#### Key Points:
- Local variables are not accessible outside their function.
- Attempting to access a local variable outside its scope results in a `NameError`.

---

### **Using the `global` Keyword**
The `global` keyword allows functions to modify global variables directly.

#### Example 3: Modifying a Global Variable
```python
x = "hello"

def foo():
    global x  # Declaring x as global
    x = 1
    x = x * 2
    print("x inside foo:", x)

foo()
print("x outside foo:", x)
```
**Output**:
```
x inside foo: 2
x outside foo: 2
```

#### Key Points:
- Without the `global` keyword, a new local variable with the same name as the global variable would be created inside the function.
- The `global` keyword should be used sparingly as it can lead to code that is harder to debug and maintain.

---

### **Conditional Variable Declaration Inside a Function**
Variables declared inside conditional blocks within a function are local and scoped to the function.

#### Example 4: Conditional Variable Declaration
```python
def foo():
    global x
    x = 1
    x = x * 2
    print(x)  # Prints 2

    if x == 2:
        z = "300"  # Local variable z
        print(z)  # Accessible within the function

foo()
# print(z)  # Raises NameError as z is local to the function
```
**Output**:
```
2
300
```

---

### **Global and Local Variable Interaction**
When a global and a local variable have the same name, the local variable takes precedence inside the function.

#### Example 5: Shadowing a Global Variable
```python
x = "global"

def foo():
    x = "local"  # Local variable shadows the global variable
    print("x inside foo:", x)

foo()
print("x outside foo:", x)
```
**Output**:
```
x inside foo: local
x outside foo: global
```

#### Key Points:
- Shadowing occurs when a local variable in a function has the same name as a global variable.
- The global variable remains unaffected by the local variable.

---

### **Common Errors and Their Explanations**
1. **Accessing a Local Variable Outside Its Scope**
   ```python
   def foo():
       y = "local"

   foo()
   print(y)  # Raises NameError
   ```
   - **Error**: `NameError: name 'y' is not defined`
   - **Reason**: `y` is a local variable and cannot be accessed outside the function.

2. **Using a Global Variable Without Declaration**
   ```python
   x = "global"

   def foo():
       x = x * 2  # UnboundLocalError
       print(x)

   foo()
   ```
   - **Error**: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment`
   - **Reason**: Python treats `x` as a local variable because it is being assigned a value. The global variable `x` is not accessible without the `global` keyword.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Avoid Overusing Global Variables**:
   - Use function parameters and return values to pass data instead of relying on global variables.
   - Excessive use of global variables can make code harder to debug and maintain.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**:
   - Use meaningful variable names to avoid confusion between global and local variables.

3. **Minimize the Use of the `global` Keyword**:
   - Instead of modifying global variables, consider encapsulating functionality within classes or using return values.

4. **Understand Scope Rules**:
   - Always be aware of where a variable is declared and its scope to prevent unintended behavior.

---

By understanding and following these principles, you can write Python code that is clear, maintainable, and free from scope-related errors.
