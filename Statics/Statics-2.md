# üìå **Inferential Statistics Notes**
---
## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Inferential Statistics**
- **Definition:** Inferential statistics involves using **sample data** to make **predictions or inferences** about a larger population.
- **Key Concept:** Instead of studying an entire population, we analyze a subset (**sample**) and apply statistical methods to generalize findings.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Normal Probability Distribution**
### **What is a Normal Distribution?**
- A **bell-shaped** and **symmetrical** distribution where:
  - Mean = Median = Mode (if perfectly normal)
  - Defined by **mean (ùúá)** and **standard deviation (ùúé)**
- **Real-World Examples:**
  - üì¶ *Shocking Inventory in a Warehouse* ‚Äì Inventory fluctuations can often follow a normal distribution.
  - üìè *Heights in a School* ‚Äì Student heights often approximate a normal curve.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Standardizing Data Values (Z-Scores)**
- **Z-Score Formula:**
  \[
  Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
  - Where **X** is a data point, **ùúá** is the mean, and **ùúé** is the standard deviation.
- **Purpose of Standardization:**
  - Helps compare scores from different distributions.
  - Converts values into a standard scale (Z-table).
- **Example:** üì¶ *Perfume bottles* are filled with an average volume of **150cc** and a standard deviation of **2cc**.
  - What percentage of bottles have a volume **> 153 cc**?
  - **Z = 1.5** (Use a Z-table to find probability).

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Population & Sample**
- **Population (N):** The entire group of interest.
- **Sample (n):** A subset of the population used for analysis.
- **Example:** Measuring the **heights of all students** in a school (population) vs. selecting **a random group** (sample).

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Interval Estimation & Confidence Intervals**
- **Point Estimator:** A single value estimate for a population parameter.
- **Confidence Interval (CI):** A range around the point estimate that likely contains the true population parameter.
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    \text{Point Estimate} \pm \text{Margin of Error}
    \]
- **Margin of Error Factors:**
  - Sample size (n)
  - Standard deviation (ùúé)
- **Confidence Intervals for Population Mean (œÉ Known):**
  - If **œÉ is known**, CI is calculated using:
    \[
    \bar{X} \pm Z \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
    \]
  - **Example Application:** Determining sample size needed for reliable estimates.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
- **Definition:** The distribution of **sample means** approaches a **normal distribution** as the **sample size increases**.
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Larger sample sizes lead to a **narrower** curve.
  - CLT allows inferential statistics even when population distribution is unknown.

### **Practice Questions**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Which rule states that the distribution of sample means becomes normal as sample size increases?
   - a) Law of Normal Distribution  
   - b) **Central Limit Theorem (‚úÖ)**  
   - c) Law of Average  
   - d) No such rule  

2Ô∏è‚É£ According to CLT, the standard deviation of the sample mean is:
   - a) **Population SD / ‚àöSample Size (‚úÖ)**
   - b) Close to population SD if sample size is large  
   - c) Always 1  
   - d) Equal to variance  

3Ô∏è‚É£ A population has **mean = 150** and **SD = 2**. If we take **samples of size 100**, what are the **mean and standard deviation** of the sampling distribution?
   - a) 50 and 2  
   - b) 150 and 2  
   - c) **150 and 0.2 (‚úÖ)**
   - d) 50 and 0.2

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ The 68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - 68% of data falls within **1ùúé** of the mean.  
  - 95% within **2ùúé**.  
  - 99.7% within **3ùúé**.  
- **Importance:** Helps assess **data spread and outliers**.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing**
- **Definition:** A structured way to test assumptions about population parameters.
- **Example:** ‚òï *A Tea Test* ‚Äì Comparing the perceived taste of two different brands using hypothesis testing.

### **Steps in Hypothesis Testing**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Define Null (H‚ÇÄ) & Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ).**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Select a Significance Level (Œ±).**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate Test Statistic (Z or t).**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Compare with Critical Value.**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Make a Decision (Reject or Fail to Reject H‚ÇÄ).**  

---

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Summary & Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Inferential Statistics** allows making conclusions about a **population** based on a **sample**.  
‚úÖ **Normal Distribution** is bell-shaped and is described using **mean & standard deviation**.  
‚úÖ **Z-Scores** help standardize data and compare distributions.  
‚úÖ **Central Limit Theorem** ensures that sample means follow a normal distribution for large **n**.  
‚úÖ **Confidence Intervals** estimate population parameters within a given margin of error.  
‚úÖ **Hypothesis Testing** helps in decision-making based on sample data.
